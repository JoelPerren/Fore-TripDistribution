# Fore-TripDistribution
One-to-many route calculations using Google Routes API

## Inputs 
Click on the map to set an origin point.
Destinations may be added either in *census mode* or *postcode mode*. Census mode takes several layers of census geography from Census Merged Local Authority Distrcits (i.e. 'Leeds'), to MSOAs (i.e. 'E02002330 : Leeds 001'), LSOAs (i.e. 'E01030525 : Mole Valley 008B'). Postcode mode takes either full postcodes or outcodes.

## Outputs
The results can be output as either GeoJSON polylines or a summary .csv file.
